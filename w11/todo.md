[]- refactor the program more prior to adding new codes
[]- locate where I can use/add regex to my program (review last week's comment)
    - Enter username (implement email address. )
[]- research JSON and how to implement it.
[]- other option is use a binary file to save the information (harder to read)
[]- write out some code
[]- ASCII art (if third party, set up virtual env)
[]- set up a menu (-1 add user,  -view list of users -generate random password, - change password?)
